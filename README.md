After installing the software, look for ESP32 access point "<bold>obsafetyAP</bold>" SSID with cellular phone and, after connection, open browser
at http://192.168.4.1, to browse ESP32 IP configuration. Choose in that page your local Wifi Network SSID and password, and
look at the Arduino IDE serial monitor for new ESP32 ip in your LAN. 

Then, open http://youresp32lanip/ and after 5 seconds, a table with all the data will appear, with a form below to allow
